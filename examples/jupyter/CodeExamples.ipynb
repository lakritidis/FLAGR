    "## Importing and using PyFLAGR\n",
    "\n",
    "PyFLAGR groups its supported rank aggregation methods in 6 modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Linear`: This module contains the `CombSUM`, `CombMNZ`, `Borda` and `SimpleBorda` classes. `CombSUM` and `CombMNZ` support five normalization methods (see Renda et al., 2003). `Borda` and `SimpleBorda` are just wrappers of `CombSUM` with `borda` and `simple-borda` normalization.\n",
    "2. `Majoritarian`: Includes `CondorcetWinners`, `CopelandWinners` and `OutrankingApproach` (Outranking Approach of Farah and Vanderpooten 2007).\n",
    "3. `MarkovChains`: Implements the four Markov Chains methods of Dwork et. al, 2001 and the MCT variant of DeConde et al. 2006.\n",
    "4. `Kemeny`: Includes `KemenyOptimal` (Kemeny Optimal Aggregation).\n",
    "5. `RRA`: Includes `RobustRA` (Robust Rank Aggregation of Kolde et al., 2012 in two variants).\n",
    "6. `Weighted`: This module implements several self-weighting rank aggregation methods. These methods automatically identify the expert voters and include:\n",
    " 1. The Preference Relations Graph method of Desarkar et al., 2016.\n",
    " 2. The Agglomerative method of Chatterjee et al., 2018.\n",
    " 3. The Iterative, Distance-Based method (DIBRA) of Akritidis et al., 2022.\n",
    " \n",
    "The following statements demonstrate the imports of all PyFLAGR rank aggregation methods in a typical jupyter notebook.\n"

    "\n",
    "A rank aggregation application involves a set of queries $Q=\\{q_1,q_2,...,q_N\\}$ and a set of rankers $R=\\{r_1,r_2,...r_m\\}$. Each query $q\\in{Q}$ is submitted to all rankers in $R$, who respond by returning a ranked list of preference items sorted in decreasing importance, or relevance order. For example, in the context of recommendation systems, a set of users may be asked to enlist their preferences as a response to the hypothetical query \"*which are your favorite games?*\". Then, a rank aggregation algorithm must merge all the submitted preference lists, discover any important latent information, and generate a single output list with improved element ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the requirements of this notebook, we use a sample dataset that was created by employing [RASDaGen](https://github.com/lakritidis/RASDaGen), a synthetic dataset generator for rank aggregation applications. The dataset includes two files: `testdata.csv` and `testdata_qrels.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The former contains preference lists that were submitted by 50 voters for 20 queries. Each input list contains 30 elements. Therefore, the number of rows in this file is equal to $50 \\times 20 \\times 30=30000$. The columns of this CSV file must be organized in the following manner:\n",

    "* `Item Score` is the preference score assigned to an item by a `Voter`, and\n",
    "* `Algorithm/Dataset` is a user-defined string that represents the origin of a particular preference list.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `testdata_qrels.csv` contains relevance judgments for the preference list elements of the primary input file for each query. It is organized in the following fashion:\n",
    "\n",
    "``Query, 0, Item Code, Relevance``\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",

    "* `0`: unused. This value must be always 0.\n",
    "* `Item Code` is a unique name that identifies each element of the preference lists,\n",
