The fusion of multiple ranked lists of elements into a single aggregate list is a well-studied research field with numerous applications in Bioinformatics, recommendation systems, collaborative filtering, election systems and metasearch engines.

FLAGR is a high performance, modular, open source library for rank aggregation problems. It implements baseline and recent state-of-the-art aggregation algorithms that accept ranked preference lists and generate a single consensus list of elements. A portion of these methods apply exploratory analysis techniques and belong to the broad family of unsupervised learning techniques.

PyFLAGR is a Python library built on top of FLAGR library core. It can be easily installed with pip and used in standard Python programs and Jupyter notebooks.
